# 🎬 Instagram Web App Clone

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a clone of the instagram web app, built using **HTML,CSS and Vanilla JavaScript**. The goal was to replicate the design and layout, make the web app responsive across devices, as well ass intergrate authentication and data handling in firebase. I also used Figma to plan the layout and functionality of the app.
